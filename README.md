✅ **I help thousands of practitioners sharpen their defensive skills** by translating complex Red Team attack lifecycles into hands-on Blue Team labs.  
✅ With over **3,500 practitioners** engaging with my content and averaging **20,000 impressions per month**, we are constantly growing and advancing our education.

My existing experience includes pursuing a **B.S. in Cybersecurity (3.93 GPA)**, serving as an **Information Security Intern for Ascend Learning**, and an **IT Intern for St. Charles County Government**. This background has afforded me a unique skillset for Blue Team roles in Enterprise Security Operations, Public Sector IT, and Cybersecurity Education.

✨ **My Projects:** Through **DonkeySec**, I analyze complex scenarios from platforms like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and Blue Team Labs Online to create practical lesson plans. I translate advanced CTF challenges into accessible, step-by-step tutorials covering Digital Forensics, Incident Response, SOC, Threat Hunting, and Malware Analysis.
